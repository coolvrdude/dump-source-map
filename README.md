Dump Source Map
===============

Extremely minimal example of restoring original source code from a source map.

## Setup

1. clone repo
2. install dependencies with `yarn`

## Usage

From the root directory of the repo run:
```
node . [file path to source map] [output directory (default: output)]
```

If successful, original source code should be written to output directory.
